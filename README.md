#### Description:
I have found myself in a situation a couple of times where I've watched a movie or a TV show and then realized that it was based on a book. So, of course, I would read the book and after finishing it, I would get angry at myself because I didn't realize earlier that the book existed.

So I've chosen to make a web app where people like me, that prefer books over movies, can come and find out if a movie or a show they were about to watch was based on a book, or a comic, or a graphical novel...

I've used the fetch API and TMDB (The Movie Data Base). The [Home page](index.html) is marked down in index.html file and the other two, [Movies page](templates/movies.html) and [TV Shows page](templates/shows.html), are in **templates folder**. All the styles are in the [same file](css/main.css) in the **css folder**.
In the **src** folder are the JS files for handling the API and for handling the navigation in mobile view.

I've named the app ***mindUnleashed*** because no movie or a tv show can compare to the mind's imagination.
